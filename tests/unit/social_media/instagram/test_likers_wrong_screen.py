"""The likers loop must not scroll into the void when it's NOT on the likers popup.

Device case (hashtag → reel): tapping a reel's like count dropped the bot into the full-screen
clips/Reels viewer instead of the likers list, so get_visible_followers returned 0 and the loop
scrolled ~50 times (~40s) doing nothing. It must detect the wrong screen and leave the post fast.
