"""Comment scraping helpers for the Instagram Persona Analysis bridge.

Besides the raw comment texts used to infer the persona, this also captures the analyzed
account's OWN lines in the comments (its top-level comments and its replies to other people) —
an authentic corpus of how it writes. Those samples ride along on the persona result and are fed
to the AI so Taktik Agent's smart comments sound like the account
(`app/ai/providers/openrouter.py::_build_style_block`). "Self" = the analyzed profile owner, so
the same flow serves a prospect (public) and our own account (connected).
