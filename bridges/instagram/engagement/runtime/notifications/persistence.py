"""Notifications persistence wiring for the Instagram notifications bridge.

Best-effort: persisting must NEVER break the scan flow.
Source of truth = Bot (records into the ``notifications`` table via NotificationService).
Security (AGENTS): never log the notification body — only usernames / counts / types.

The activity feed has no account header (unlike the DM inbox's igds_action_bar_title),
so the owning account is passed in by the front (resolved via getLatestDeviceAccounts) —
see notifications-persistence-spec.md. Linking the actor to social_profiles + computing
attribution is deferred to a later step (this module only dedups + flags is_new).
